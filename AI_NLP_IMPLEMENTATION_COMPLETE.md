### 📊 Sample Output
```
📊 DAILY TRADING SUMMARY
Session: live_session_2025-08-20_13-17
Duration: 0.58 hours

💰 PERFORMANCE
Return: 0.0000%
Trades: 0 (0 buy, 0 sell)
Success Rate: 0.00%

🎯 TOP RECOMMENDATIONS
• Trade success rate is below 50% - consider adjusting entry/exit thresholds
• No trades executed - consider lowering thresholds or increasing monitoring frequency
• High volatility detected in ETH/CAD, BTC/CAD - consider tighter stop-losses

🤖 AI INSIGHT
Trading session ran for 0.58 hours with 7 data collection points. Portfolio remained 
stable with 0 trades executed. High volatility was observed in ETH/CAD, BTC/CAD, 
presenting both opportunities and risks. The session showed modest performance with 
room for improvement.
