## 📋 Complete Feature List

### 1. 🔮 Predictive Price Movement Models
**Objective**: Use AI to predict short-term price shifts for pairs (BTC/CAD, ETH/BTC, etc.)
- **Why**: Act before arbitrage appears to others
- **How**: Train lightweight ML models (LSTM, XGBoost) on price and volume data
- **Prediction Window**: 1-30 seconds ahead
- **Result**: Pre-emptive trades or hold decisions based on predicted price movements

### 2. 🤖 Trade Opportunity Classification (AI Filtering)
**Objective**: Train a model to classify trades by success probability
- **Classifications**:
  - "Fake positive" (appears profitable but will fail due to slippage/delay)
  - "True positive" (likely to execute well)
  - "Too risky" (high probability of loss)
- **Inputs**: Profit %, price volatility, spread width, historical success/failure
- **Output**: Trade confidence score → only execute if score > threshold

### 3. 📊 Real-Time Data Enrichment (LLMs)
**Objective**: Use LLMs (GPT-4o) for external data analysis
- **Data Sources**: Kraken news feeds, Twitter, Reddit
- **Analysis**: Flag news impacting BTC/ETH volatility
- **Examples**: Fed rate news, ETF approvals, regulatory changes
- **Result**: Bot enters "high-risk" or "opportunity" mode based on external conditions

### 4. 📈 AI-Powered Fee Optimization Strategy
**Objective**: Use AI to learn optimal fee timing and order types
- **Learning Targets**:
  - Volume-tiered fee system optimization
  - Trading behavior patterns
  - Time of day effects
  - Order type selection (limit vs. market)
- **Recommendations**: When to hold off for lower fees, cheapest trading paths

### 5. 📁 NLP for Arbitrage Strategy Logs + Summaries
**Objective**: Transform log files into actionable insights
- **Daily Summaries**: "You missed 3 profitable trades between 10–11 AM"
- **Trade Analysis**: "Your profit would be 40% higher by skipping ETH→BTC leg"
- **Natural Language Reports**: LLM-generated strategy decision support

### 6. 🔁 Dynamic Threshold Optimization
**Objective**: Use RL/Bayesian Optimization for continuous parameter tuning
- **Parameters**: min_profit_pct, delay intervals, slippage buffer
- **Method**: Reinforcement Learning or Bayesian Optimization
- **Reward**: Based on successful (simulated) profits
- **Result**: Bot auto-optimizes behavior over time

### 7. 🛡️ Risk Detection AI
**Objective**: AI-powered risk signal detection
- **Risk Signals**:
  - Sudden illiquidity
  - Price manipulation patterns
  - Suspicious spreads (pump-and-dumps)
  - Market anomalies
- **Result**: Prevents bot from executing into traps

### 8. 🧠 Reinforcement Learning for Full Bot Control (Advanced)
**Objective**: Train deep RL agent for complete trading control
- **Scope**: Multiple exchanges, multiple pairs
- **Learning**: Patterns in volatility, fees, latency
- **Execution**: Optimal arbitrage trades over time
- **Status**: Highly experimental, potentially extremely profitable
